After working through this R assignment, it was clear that to make sure there are no huge
issues in between commands, we need to run every line separately in the R script. It is a nice work
space to be able to practice on and if there is a problem, all you have to do is go to that
area and type in the correction, without having to start a whole new line or command. 
The fixed version of the code is right because all of the lines work separetly and also piped into
the next commands. The data expressed at the end when viewed matched what the finished product
should have looked like. If there were 1000s of lines of data, this process of checking each
individual line would be a bit tedious, but it does mark which lines are incorrect if there
is an issue with running the code. I am sure there are faster ways of cleaning up the data and 
double checking it.
